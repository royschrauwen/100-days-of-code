# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 3: Tuesday February 1 2022

  **Today's Progress**: Some education on Design Principles and some JavaScript-coding with a tutorial.

  **Thoughts** To educate myself I did a course on Linkedin Learning about Software Design Principles. Very informative. During the course I kept wanting to look at my own code to try to improve it. I will do that soon.

Afterwards I followed the tutorial 'Build a Touch Slider with HTML, CSS & JavaScript' by Trversy Media. Nice to be learning some more JavaScript!
