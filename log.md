# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Sunday January 30

**Today's Progress**: I made some cards with HTML and CSS for my Software Development Task Manager project

**Thoughts:** I was already working on this project prior to starting this challenge. I want to learn more by making a project and that project should be usefull for myself. That's why I am making an improved ToDo-app. Making the cards was fun. I like HTML and CSS. But because I had not thought of all the functions of the program, I think I need to revise the cards in a later stadium. But for now it is a better look and I am happy with the progress.

### Day 3: Tuesday February 1 2022

**Today's Progress**: Some education on Design Principles and some JavaScript-coding with a tutorial.

**Thoughts** To educate myself I did a course on Linkedin Learning about Software Design Principles. Very informative. During the course I kept wanting to look at my own code to try to improve it. I will do that soon.

Afterwards I followed the tutorial 'Build a Touch Slider with HTML, CSS & JavaScript' by Trversy Media. Nice to be learning some more JavaScript!
