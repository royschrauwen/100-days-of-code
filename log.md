# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Sunday January 30

**Today's Progress**: I made some cards with HTML and CSS for my Software Development Task Manager project

**Thoughts:** I was already working on this project prior to starting this challenge. I want to learn more by making a project and that project should be usefull for myself. That's why I am making an improved ToDo-app. Making the cards was fun. I like HTML and CSS. But because I had not thought of all the functions of the program, I think I need to revise the cards in a later stadium. But for now it is a better look and I am happy with the progress.



### Day 2: Monday January 31

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.




### Day 3: Tuesday February 1 2022

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
