# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Sunday January 30

**Today's Progress**: I made some cards with HTML and CSS for my Software Development Task Manager project

**Thoughts:** I was already working on this project prior to starting this challenge. I want to learn more by making a project and that project should be usefull for myself. That's why I am making an improved ToDo-app. Making the cards was fun. I like HTML and CSS. But because I had not thought of all the functions of the program, I think I need to revise the cards in a later stadium. But for now it is a better look and I am happy with the progress.
