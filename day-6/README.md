**Today's Progress**
Today I completed another Frontend Mentor Challenge. I only had to use some HTML and CSS, so it was a quick and fun excersise. I used a Mobile-First approach and later tried to adapt the styling to a Desktop view. Because the card had the same look on both devices, I only had to change a couple of lines.
