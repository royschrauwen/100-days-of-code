**Today's Progress**
Today I completed another Frontend Mentor Challenge. I only had to use some HTML and CSS, so it was a quick and fun excersise. I used a Mobile-First approach and later tried to adapt the styling to a Desktop view. Because the card had the same look on both devices, I only had to change a couple of lines.

## Day 3: Tuesday February 1 2022

  **Today's Progress**: Some education on Design Principles and some JavaScript-coding with a tutorial.

  **Thoughts** To educate myself I did a course on Linkedin Learning about Software Design Principles. Very informative. During the course I kept wanting to look at my own code to try to improve it. I will do that soon.

Afterwards I followed the tutorial 'Build a Touch Slider with HTML, CSS & JavaScript' by Trversy Media. Nice to be learning some more JavaScript!

## Day 2: Monday January 31

  

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued working on my Requirementanalysis Task Manager project. I made it so users can assign tasks to themselves.

  

**Thoughts**: Implementing CRUD into my project is a big part of the learning process. The next semester of school is all about databases and SQL, so practicing this beforehand will give me a better understanding and helps me ask specific questions in class.

## Day 1: Sunday January 30

  

**Today's Progress**: I made some cards with HTML and CSS for my Software Development Task Manager project

  

**Thoughts:** I was already working on this project prior to starting this challenge. I want to learn more by making a project and that project should be usefull for myself. That's why I am making an improved ToDo-app. Making the cards was fun. I like HTML and CSS. But because I had not thought of all the functions of the program, I think I need to revise the cards in a later stadium. But for now it is a better look and I am happy with the progress.
